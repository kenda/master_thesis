\section*{Abstract}
This thesis will present a solution for a simple way to answer several drug related questions, like ``What are the side effects of drug X?'' or ``Do drug X and drug Y interact with each other?''.
The knowledge foundation used for these queries are Linked Data knowledge bases which allow comprehensive queries over semantic data.
The presented approach provides an Application Programming Interface (API) for the different questions that allows an usage without any background knowledge about the data sources and their structures.
Additionally the predefined questions support the ``Drug Management life cycle'' introduced by the World Health Organization.
Finally the presented solution will be evaluated by integrating it in the Dispedia and DrugMan project.
